We were very surprised by an inquiry from a farmer who wanted to use ${appName} to count bonuses for people picking blueberries. The client was initially interested in writing such an application from scratch for his needs but concluded that ${appName} meets 90% of his requirements and in addition contains several features that he did not even think about because, in addition to collecting data, you can count this data and share it with people working in the field. At first, ${appName} was to be used only by shift managers. However, it turned out that adding users and making their performance available to them will allow for greater motivation and will remove the need for managers to print performance tables. So we were able to shorten the whole process of calculating bonuses by adding thresholds and providing individual accounts to employees.
