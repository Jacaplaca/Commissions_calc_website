Small establishment employing 4 hairdressers. Before ${appName} bonuses were counted on a piece of paper once a week, and it took about an hour. That is 4 hours per month. Each employee additionally counted on their own to be able to check the calculations of the owner. Sometimes conflicts arose in this background. There were no thresholds. Several services were divided into 3 groups, which were rewarded with a percentage and a fixed amount. In the beginning, the client resisted introducing the system into his company, but he was convinced by the free trial period and time savings. He calculated that the monthly cost of the system would pay for itself in the first week by saving an hour he would spend cutting customers' hair. 

Today, the company can't imagine working without ${appName}. Employees have stopped counting commissions on their own. They record transactions via cell phones and can constantly check how much they have earned. The owner spends several minutes a month on the system to check the amounts and modify the commission system.

Thresholds were also introduced, which had been previously planned but were constantly postponed because no one wanted to count them. Thanks to the thresholds, employees try harder because they know exactly where they are and how little or how much they lack to reach the next level.
