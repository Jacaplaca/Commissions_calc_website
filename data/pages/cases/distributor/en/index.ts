The company has dozens of salesman, 3 teams, 400 products, and dozens of services. The dealer has a very complicated commission system based on different commissions for every group of products. Additionally, there were many thresholds different for products and services. To count that, the company analyst needed many hours of deep work. Employees could only see their results once a month and have only a few days for complaints. Because of this, much conflict has built up.

In addition to the ${appName} implementation, we also created a data warehouse, thanks to which transactions were automatically assigned to the seller. As a result of the integration and implementation, managers created commission systems that were even more well-thought-out and thus more effective than before. In addition, we eliminated the counting process. Similarly, sending reports to employees. Everyone involved has an up-to-date view of their progress. As a result, they can make much more informed decisions than before. Managers know whom to help, and employees know how much they lack to reach the next threshold and what to do to cross it. There are no more conflicts about commissions because everything is clear, and if there are any, they are spread out and not accumulated as before when the report is sent.
