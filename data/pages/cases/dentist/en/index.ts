Before using ${appName}, the practice did not use any special commission system. The company paid employees for time spent in the office and percent on each client. The biggest argument for using ${appName} was for the owner's ability to add commission thresholds.  The owner also wanted to set different commissions for different services to consider their real impact on the company's performance. After all, not everything was equally profitable from the owner's point of view, and this was not reflected in the commissions paid.  Transactions are added manually by the person working at the front desk. For the first month, ${appName} was used parallel with the old way of calculating commissions. Employees were to decide which approach they preferred and decide which system to use. It turned out that despite the more complicated way of calculating commissions, ${appName} was accepted very well. Employees unanimously assessed that they prefer to use the new way to check their results every day. Additionally, the new thresholds introduced an element of gamification, not to mention saving time on counting.
